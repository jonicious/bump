# Bump - show a random gif

This a simple app created during a [workshop](http://www.meetup.com/de/opentechschool-dortmund/events/223912144/) at #otsconf15. You shake your device and it shows you a random gif using the [Giphy API](https://github.com/giphy/GiphyAPI). By holding it upside, it copies the url to your clipboard.

## Gulp

The CSS is written in SCSS. In your project folder, run the following snippet to compile it:

	npm install && gulp scss
